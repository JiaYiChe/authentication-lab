Q1:authentication scheme used in Django Rest Framework's browsable API is session authentication. It is managed by the framework itself, which checks for the presence of a valid session cookie in each request.

Q2:httpie uses basic authentication scheme by default when the -a or --auth option flag is used to provide credentials for a request.

Q3:Session authentication creates a session between the user and the server, while token authentication issues a unique token to the user. 
Token authentication is an improvement over basic authentication as it does not require the server to store user credentials, is more secure, and more scalable.

Q4:When click "Log in with Google" on a website that uses OAuth2 for authentication, the website sends an authentication request to Google, and if you grant permission, Google sends an access token to the website. 
The website can use this token to access your Google account data, and you are now logged in to the website using your Google account.
